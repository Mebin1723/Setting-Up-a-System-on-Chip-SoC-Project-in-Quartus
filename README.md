# Setting-Up-a-System-on-Chip-SoC-Project-in-Quartus
To set up a System on Chip (SoC) project in Quartus, launch Quartus and license it if needed. Start a new project, select the correct FPGA, add Verilog code, and compile. Assign the FPGA pins, then re-compile. Configure additional IP cores using Platform Designer and verify the setup with ModelSim and SignalTap Logic Analyzer.
